# YouTube Autoplay Selenium Script

This project is a Python-based script that uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of visiting a YouTube video and automatically playing it. The script can repeatedly open the video in a browser, play it for a set duration, and then close the browser. It's a useful tool for automating video views or testing purposes.

## Overview
This project leverages the power of Selenium to automate YouTube video views. The script opens a specific YouTube URL, plays the video for 30 seconds, and repeats the process. This can be useful for testing, automated views, or other applications where automation is needed for YouTube.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome (or any other browser of your choice)
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your version of Chrome)
- Selenium Python module

### Other Dependencies
- XLaunch for Linux users to provide GUI support on headless servers.
- `pip` to manage Python packages.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

3. Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), and place it in `/usr/local/bin` or a directory of your choice. Make sure it is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver
    ```

4. Set up `XLaunch` for GUI applications on Linux:
    - Set the environment variable for display:
    ```bash
    export DISPLAY=:0
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the `main.py` script in your editor to configure the YouTube video URL:
    ```python
    url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
    ```

2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will open a Chrome window, navigate to the YouTube URL, play the video for 30 seconds, and close the browser. It will repeat the process in an infinite loop.

### Script Features
- **Autoplay:** Automatically starts the video upon opening the URL.
- **Looping:** Reopens the browser after playing the video for 30 seconds.
- **Error Handling:** The script attempts to recover from common errors, such as network issues or browser failures.

### Example
Hereâ€™s how the script runs:
```bash
Opening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID
Video autoplay started...
Playing video for 30 seconds...
Closing browser...
Reopening video...


Features
Autoplay Video: The script automatically starts playing the YouTube video using JavaScript, simulating a spacebar press or direct play function.
Looping Mechanism: After playing the video for a set time (30 seconds), the script closes the browser and reopens it to start the process again.
Error Handling: The script gracefully handles issues, such as browser crashes or network failures, by retrying up to three times with different configurations.
Future Enhancements
Proxy Support: We plan to implement the use of rotating proxies to make each session appear unique, simulating traffic from different locations.
GUI Interface with Tkinter: A user-friendly GUI will be built using Tkinter, allowing non-technical users to run the script with ease and customize options, such as video URL, duration, and the number of loops.
